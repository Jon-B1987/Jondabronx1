👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan (@Jondabronx1)

☁️ Cloud Engineer in Training | AWS • Linux • Python • Infrastructure

I’m transitioning into cloud engineering after several years working in law enforcement, as a sheriff deputy, and as a detention officer at a 24/7 mission-critical public safety environment.

🔧 What I work on  
- Cloud infrastructure and AWS labs (VPC, EC2, S3, IAM, networking)  
- Python backend development (APIs, automation, data handling)  
- Linux administration and shell scripting  
- Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, subnets, routing)  
- Small backend services and cloud-style architectures  

💻 I code for fun and for the future  
I enjoy building things — from automation scripts to backend services — and learning how modern cloud platforms are designed, deployed, and operated at scale.

📚 Currently learning  
- AWS Cloud Practitioner → Solutions Architect path  
- Linux & Bash scripting  
- Cloud networking & infrastructure  
- Python for backend and automation  

🎯 Career goal  
Cloud Engineer / Cloud Operations / SRE — building reliable, scalable systems that don’t go down when it matters.
