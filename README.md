# Hi, I'm Jonathan Bell 👋

**Aspiring Cloud & Infrastructure Engineer | AWS-Focused | Operations & Reliability Mindset**

I’m a former law enforcement professional transitioning into **cloud infrastructure and data technology operations**, with a strong focus on **AWS, system reliability, and large-scale operational environments. I am particularly interested in roles supporting data center operations, hardware infrastructure, and cloud platform environments where reliability and hands-on system support are critical.**.

I bring 6+ years of experience working in **24/7 mission-critical facilities** where uptime, rapid incident response, documentation, and strict procedural execution were essential. I’m now applying that same operational discipline to cloud systems — building hands-on labs, learning infrastructure technologies, and developing the skills needed to support production environments.

## ☁️ What I'm Focused On

I am actively building practical experience for roles such as:

- Cloud Support Engineer  
- Cloud Infrastructure / Cloud Operations  
- Data Center / Data Tech Operations  
- Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)  

My goal is to help organizations run **reliable, secure, and well-monitored systems**.

## 🧪 My Hands-On Labs

This GitHub contains cloud labs designed to simulate real-world cloud and operations scenarios, including:

- Event-driven serverless workflows  
- AWS Lambda integrations  
- DynamoDB data persistence  
- API Gateway backends  
- Monitoring and logging with CloudWatch  
- IAM permissions and security concepts  

Each project is built to strengthen my understanding of how cloud systems are deployed, monitored, and supported in production environments.

## 📈 Current Goals

- Earn AWS certifications (Cloud Practitioner → Solutions Architect)  
- Continue building AWS labs and documenting projects  
- Grow into a cloud support, infrastructure, or reliability engineering role  
- Develop deeper knowledge in automation, monitoring, and system operations
